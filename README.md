# CanYouHearMeNow

## Design one

For this design, I wanted the typography to create the sound waves of a megaphone to show that when the type is getting bigger, the sound would be getting louder. I used a gradual gradient to also represent that it would be getting louder. I chose turquoise as my main colour as it represents communication and clarity.

## Design two

The colours for this design are the same as my 4th design. They were chosen to represent both the C.I.A (Ed Snowden used to work for them) and also the American colour. The typography used is very bold to get the message across that heâ€™s frustrated or maybe shouting to be heard. The first thing most people think of with hearing is an ear so I used the shape of an ear to cut out a portion of the text in that shape but you can still easily read the message/tweet.

## Design four

The colours and typorgraphy used for this design is linked to Ed Snowden's background.He used to work for the C.I.A so I used the colours from their badge. As for the typography it has a very corporate look to it to represent him better. I used repetition of the tweet to create the image of the ear with a headphone to show a visualisation of the tweet.
