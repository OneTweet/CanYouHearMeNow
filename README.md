# One Tweet - Can you hear me now? 

## Initial ideas

Below are my initial ideas. I created these without any design thinking and more about representation of the tweet and/or linking it to Edward Snowden. After showing these ideas in my tutorial I had feedback that I should look more into colour, typography, the visual perception principles we learnt about and the meaning behind why I have created it the way that I have. All of my initial ideas then developed into my final designs. For each one I have explained what improvements I want to implement due to the feedback I recieved in the tutorial and also the aspects that I personally don't like about them.

This design was the first one that I created. When I thought about the meaning of the tweet and especially 'hear me now?' my initial thought was a megaphone to help someone hear. I carried on with this idea for my final design. However, in this one I didn't completely think about the colours used. I have kept the gradient but I had no reasoning behind why I chose red. Also with this design there is no use of white space and the text looks quite cramped. The use of white space will act well with this idea as it's directly relateable to the tweet itself, using a megaphone in an open space will ensure that they will be heard.

For this design I wanted to use colours that represent Edward Snowden. As he used to work for the C.I.A I used the colours from the badge. As for the font, I also linked this into the C.I.A as i chose a corporate looking font to fit well. I did however want to change the amount of white space just like the one above as I feel that it is very cramped and looks a bit bold. I will keep the idea of cutting an ear shape out of the text as I believe it represnts the tweet esaily and well.

As above, for this design I didn't really think about the colour when creating this and wanted to look into the psychology of colour in order to create something with more meaning. I tried to create something that represented the sound waves of a cartoon megaphone. I didn't like this end result as I feel it looks like a 2D drawing of a christmas tree! I thought about the font for this design and wanted something that was bold to stand out from the background even with a small font size.

This initial idea didn't completely fit the brief as it still has an image in it. I did get rid of this for the final design but I wanted to show the basis I used to create the ear out of repeated tweets. This was also made without thinking about colour or the meaning behind it. I wanted to use the literal meaning behind the tweet and therefor used an ear with a headphone in it but also the bold font to show the feeling behind the tweet which could maybe be anger or frustration.

Finally, I wanted to create a design that created a full picture. Therefor I thought about what the tweet could create. I came up with the idea of someone wearing a earphone that's made up of the tweet so that it doesn't use any images just like the face itself. However, apart from the earphone it didn't have any other link so I wanted to develop this further to have more meaning. Just like the previous design, I wanted a bold type to convey the emotion behind the tweet, but also it made the image stand out a lot more. I also want to look at the psychology of colour to have meaning behind that as well.


# Final ideas

After creating a starting point with my initial designs, I developed them furhter. Looking into meaning, choosing my colours based on the psychology of colour, choosing speciifc fonts that link well with my deisgn and also implementing visual perception principles that I have learnt about. Below are my final designs for this project.

## Design one

For this design, I wanted the typography to create the sound waves of a megaphone to show that when the type is getting bigger, the sound would be getting louder. I used a gradual gradient to also represent that it would be getting louder. I chose turquoise as my main colour as it represents communication and clarity. I included the use of white space for this design as I wanted it to have 'room to breathe' to make it look more appealing but also directly relate to the tweet to embody the thought behind the tweet.

## Design two

The colours for this design are the same as my 4th design. They were chosen to represent both the C.I.A (Ed Snowden used to work for them) and also the American flag colour. The typography used is very bold to get the message across that he’s frustrated or maybe shouting to be heard. The first thing most people think of with hearing is an ear so I used the shape of an ear to cut out a portion of the text in that shape but you can still easily read the message/tweet.

## Design three

This is my third design, I used repetition, continuation and symmetry to show the look of sound waves. I chose gold for the main colour in this image as gold represents success and tirumph which can be shown by the sound waves getting louder and someone hearing. I wanted to use the visual perception principle of continuation as the tweet is a rhetorical question so there may not be an answer just like this design doesn’t have an end.

## Design four

The colours and typorgraphy used for this design is linked to Ed Snowden's background.He used to work for the C.I.A so I used the colours from their badge. As for the typography it has a very corporate look to it to represent him better. The repetition of the tweet in the background was used to create the effect you may see in a magazine with the target of the interview's image in the middle with all the questions behind them or at an event with advertisment behind them e.g. (http://welovesoaps.com/wls30/chrishell2.png) . I used repetition of the tweet to create the image of the ear with a headphone to show a visualisation of the tweet.

## Design five

For my final design I created Ed Snowden out of his tweet. I used repetition again to make the shape and features of his face. I used a bold type so that it would stand out and not create a faint image. The main colour I used for this design is orange as it is the colour of social communication which is linked more to where the tweet came from but also orange is the colour of optimism which links to the meaning of the tweet itself with it getting an answer.
