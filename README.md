# CanYouHearMeNow

## Design one

For this design, I wanted the typography to create the sound waves of a megaphone to show that when the type is getting bigger, the sound would be getting louder. I used a gradual gradient to also represent that it would be getting louder. I chose turquoise as my main colour as it represents communication and clarity.

## Design four

The colours and typorgraphy used for this design is linked to Ed Snowden's background.He used to work for the C.I.A so I used the colours from their badge. As for the typography it has a very corporate look to it to represent him better. I used repetition of the tweet to create the image of the ear with a headphone to show a visualisation of the tweet.
